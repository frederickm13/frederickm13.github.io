# About Me
My name is Frederick McCollum, but I go by Erick. I am a motivated IT
professional with an unrivaled passion for technology, learning, and building
valuable relationships. I strive to utilize modern technology to create valuable
solutions, make a positive business impact, and empower others.

I am currently employed by *[Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/)* as a Software Engineer based in Irving, Tx (Dallas - Fort Worth Area). I graduated from *[Schreiner University](https://schreiner.edu/)* in May of 2017 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Information Systems, including minors in both Mathematics and Finance. While working full time, I am now also enrolled in a Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the *[University of Dallas](https://udallas.edu/)*.
