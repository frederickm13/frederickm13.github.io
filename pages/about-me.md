# About Me
My name is Frederick McCollum, but I go by Erick. I am a motivated IT
professional with an unrivaled passion for technology, learning, and building
valuable relationships. I strive to utilize modern technology to create valuable
solutions, make a positive business impact, and empower others.

I am currently employed by *[H-E-B](https://www.heb.com/)* as a Software Engineer II based in San Antonio, TX. I graduated from *[Schreiner University](https://schreiner.edu/)* in May of 2017 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Information Systems, including minors in both Mathematics and Finance. While working full time, I am also enrolled in a Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the *[University of Dallas](https://udallas.edu/)*, with an expected graduation date of December, 2021.
