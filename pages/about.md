# About
My name is Frederick McCollum, but I go by Erick. I am a well-organized leader with a work ethic that has never been seen before. Every day I bring a sense of humor and contagious, positive energy. Communication is my best strength, and I honestly enjoy writing documentation. I have an unrivaled passion for technology, learning, solving problems, and building valuable relationships. If you give me a chance, I will be a respected leader within 6 months of joining your team. 

I am currently employed by *[H-E-B](https://www.heb.com/)* as a Software Engineer II based in San Antonio, TX. I graduated from *[Schreiner University](https://schreiner.edu/)* in May of 2017 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Information Systems, including minors in both Mathematics and Finance. I graduated from the *[University of Dallas](https://udallas.edu/)* in December of 2021 with a Master of Science in Business Analytics.
