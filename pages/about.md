My name is Frederick McCollum, but I go by Erick. I am currently employed by [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/) as a Dynamics 365 Support Engineer based in Irving, Tx (Dallas - Fort Worth Area). I recently graduated from Schreiner University in May, 2017, with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Information Systems with minors in both Mathematics and Finance. In my time at Schreiner I was able to maintain a 3.97 cumulative grade point average, while also carrying a heavy course load and being highly involved on campus. I believe that this is a proven testament to my ability to prioritize and manage my time effectively in order to meet my current and long-term goals.

Along with great organizational skills, I am a very fast learner with a strong willingness to expand my knowledge and grow. I look forward to performing the best that I can in order to create the most value possible for any of my future endeavors, both in my career and my personal life.
