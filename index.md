My name is Frederick McCollum, but I go by Erick. I am currently employed by [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/) as a Business Applications Developer Consultant based in Irving, Tx (Dallas - Fort Worth Area). I graduated from [Schreiner University](https://schreiner.edu/) in May of 2017 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Information Systems, including minors in both Mathematics and Finance. While working full time, I am now also enrolled in a Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the [University of Dallas](https://udallas.edu/).

In my time at [Schreiner University](https://schreiner.edu/) I was able to maintain a 3.97 cumulative grade point average, while also carrying a heavy course load and being highly involved on campus. I believe that this is a proven testament of my ability to prioritize and manage my time effectively in order to meet my current and long-term goals. Along with great organizational skills, I am a very fast learner with a strong willingness to expand my knowledge and grow. I look forward to performing the best that I can in order to create the most value possible for any of my future endeavors, both in my career and my personal life.
