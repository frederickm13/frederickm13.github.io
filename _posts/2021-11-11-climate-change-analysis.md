## Overview
Full video presentation may be found on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/LJKhARLmn-s](https://youtu.be/LJKhARLmn-s).

As part of this project, I performed an analysis of CDP (www.cdp.net) climate survey data. This CDP climate survey data was retrieved from a Kaggle.com data competition (Unlocking Climate Solutions: https://www.kaggle.com/c/cdp-unlocking-climate-solutions/data). In order to help guide this project, I developed appropriate business questions and goals, as well as some more technical analytics goals. I have included each of these below: 

**Business questions.**
-	What are the biggest action points for cities and corporations to mitigate climate issues? 
-	What KPIs can be used to measure success of these action points? 

**Business goals.**
-	Identify primary action points for cities/corporations to mitigate climate issues.
-	Determine/develop KPIs to measure success towards the action points that were identified in phase one.

**Analytics goals.**
-	Analyze and perform exploratory analysis of CDP climate survey data and identify any significant patterns/trends.
-	Develop measurable KPIs based on the identified patterns/trends in phase one.

The objective of this project was to answer the above-mentioned business questions, as well as achieve the above-mentioned business and analytics goals. The outcome of this project was to produce measurable KPIs that cities and corporations can use to improve their sustainability footprint.

## Methods
The following high-level steps were taken to carry out this project:
1.	Parse, clean, and insert the CDP climate survey data into an Amazon Web Services cloud PostgreSQL database using Python and SQL.
2.	Create analytics-focused queries, views, and tables in the AWS cloud PostgreSQL database.
3.	Connect to the AWS cloud PostgreSQL database using Tableau.
4.	Using Tableau, create charts and dashboards targeted toward business outcomes.

## My Role
This was an individual project. Therefore, I did not have a specific role within a team.

## Learning Outcome
During this project, I learned valuable skills such as developing and organizing a business-focused project, creating and managing AWS cloud resources, connecting to AWS cloud PostgreSQL databases through Tableau, and creating complex charts and dashboards in Tableau that target business outcomes. This learning outcome demonstrates my high technical competence, organizational skills, as well as my ability to quickly learn and apply new skills.

## Rationale
I believe the above-mentioned learning outcomes are supported by the deliverables that were produced as part of this project. Over a short period of time, I produced many high-quality deliverables. These deliverables included 1) a well-structured, performant PostgreSQL database containing CDP climate survey data, 2) Python and SQL scripts for ingesting, cleaning, and inserting data into the cloud PostgreSQL database, 3) complex Tableau charts and dashboards targeting business outcomes, and 4) measurable KPIs for cities/corporations to improve their overall sustainability footprint.
