Are you looking for ways to measure the performance of your Python code/applications? 

Three popular ways to measure the performance of Python code are: 
- Using the [`time.perf_counter()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter) function.
- Using the [`timeit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html) module.
- Using the [`profile` and `cProfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile) modules.

I will be discussing each of these three ways in more detail below. 

## Using the `time.perf_counter()` function.
