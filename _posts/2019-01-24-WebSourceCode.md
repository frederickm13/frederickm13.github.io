I am very excited to be actively developing my own website! I would like to thank my colleagues, [Apurv](https://apurvghai.com/) and [Austin](https://aucarr.com/) for their help and support with this project. Also, last but DEFINITELY not least, this would not be possible without the great, user-friendly hosting services of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)! If you are interested, please take a moment to view the source code for this site. Additionally, please check back often. I will be updating this site and/or adding new content regularly (or at least I am planning to do so).
