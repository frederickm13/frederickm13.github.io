This is a web application which was created as my capstone project for *[HarvardX's Computer Science for Web Programming](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-computer-science-for-web-programming)* professional certificate program. A short YouTube video overview of the application may be found at the following link: [https://youtu.be/NRXig6r-McI](https://youtu.be/NRXig6r-McI).

This web application (nick-named "MovieRater") allows users to login, search/add movies to the web app's database, add reviews to movies, read other user's reviews, as well as view the average review for each movie based on all user's reviews. This web application was created using Django (Python web application framework) and React.js (JavaScript framework for creating single page applications). This minimizes requests and responses sent between client and server, which provides a more seamless experience for the user at the UI level.
