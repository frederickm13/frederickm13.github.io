I created three different predictive models with the objective of predicting NCAA March Madness tournament results. The three model types which were created are as follows: 
1. Random Forest
2. Neural Network
3. Stochastic Gradient Boosting

When comparing the performance of the three models, I found that the Stochastic Gradient Boosting model performed the best on my test sample data set.
