I would like to share one of my recently completed projects as a student in the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at [The University of Dallas](https://udallas.edu/). This project is an in-depth analysis of Dallas Animal Services data using modern cloud technologies. 

Some of the technologies that I utilized in this analysis include SQL, Microsoft Azure, Power BI, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, SQL Server Management Studio, and Azure Blob Storage.
